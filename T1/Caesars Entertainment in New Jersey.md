## Caesars Entertainment in New Jersey

Caesars Entertainment in New Jersey emailed **promotions to 250 people who self-identify as compulsive online gamblers** and are trying to avoid exactly this type of temptation by adding themselves to a do-not-send list.
<br>
It says a ***"back-end software issue"*** caused it to wrongly e-mail promotional gambling material to more than 250 "compulsive" online gamblers.
<br>
> *"The issue that caused our system to inadvertently target their patrons has been fixed and we have had no incidents since," Palansky said in a statement Wednesday. "We can assure the public that this lapse on our part was not an intentional targeting of their patrons, but simply a back-end software issue that failed to properly scrub our database before certain mailings."*

The promotional materials were emailed to more than 250 internet self-excluded gamblers between Feb. 16 and May 28 as well as 19 individuals on the self-exclusion list during that same time frame.
<br>
Even though online gambling is legal, caesars entertainment corp has been hit with a **$10,000 civil penalty**.
<br>
It's not the first time Caesars has been dinged in connection to compulsive gambling. In May, **it was penalized $3,000 because it did not include in a legible manner the compulsive gambling "1-800-GAMBLER" phone hotline** on billboards hawking online gambling.
