## Software Glitch Accidentally Releases Prisoners
**More than 3,200 US prisoners have been released early because of a software glitch. The bug miscalculated the sentence reductions prisoners in Washington state had received for good behaviour.** It was introduced in 2002 as part of an update that followed a court ruling about applying good behaviour credits. State officials say the early releases **have been happening by accident for more than 13 years**.

The governor's general counsel. He said the problem was first flagged when a crime victim's family was notified the perpetrator was about to get out — early.

Washington state officials are now in full damage-control mode. Until the software is fixed, they say no one will be released without a "hand-calculation" of the release date. State officials said that many early-release prisoners would have to return to jail to finish their sentences. Analysis of the errors showed that, on average, **prisoners whose sentences were wrongly calculated got out 49 days early. One prisoner had his sentence cut by 600 days**. In a conference cal, Dan Pacholke, the state's secretary of corrections, said the state is still digging into what crimes may have been committed by ex-cons in the period of time they should have still been in prison. Prematurely released prisoners are charged with causing two deaths, one a DUI vehicular homicide. Local police are now helping to round up those who still need to spend time in jail. So far, 31 of the early released inmates have been taken back into custody. Most of those who've been taken back into custody have not been accused of committing new crimes while they were on the outside.
