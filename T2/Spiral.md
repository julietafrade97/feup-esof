<p align="justify"> The <b>spiral model</b> is a <b>risk-driven process model generator for software projects.</b> Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping. This model was first described by <b>Barry Boehm</b> in his <b>1986</b> paper "A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement".</p>

Boehm identified a **number of misconceptions arising from oversimplifications** in the original spiral model diagram, such as:
* The spiral is simply a sequence of waterfall increments.
* All project activities follow a single spiral sequence.
* Every activity in the diagram must be performed, and in the order shown.

**Authentic applications** of the spiral model are driven by cycles that always display **six characteristics** and **four phases.**

### The Six Invariants
* Define artefacts concurrently.
* Perform four basic activities in every cycle.
* Risk determines level of effort. 
* Risk determines degree of details.
* Use anchor point milestones.
* Focus on the system and its life cycle.

As mentioned above, the spiral model has **four phases.** A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.
* Phase 1: **Identification**
* Phase 2: **Risk Analysis**
* Phase 3: **Engineering and Evaluation**
* Phase 4: **Planning**

### When to use Spiral method
* When costs and risk evaluation is important.
* For medium to high-risk projects.
* Long-term project commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities.
* Users are unsure of their needs.
* Requirements are complex.
* New product line.
* Significant changes are expected (research and exploration).

### Advantages
* Changing requirements can be accommodated.
* Allows extensive use of prototypes.
* Requirements can be captured more accurately.
* Users see the system early.
* Development can be divided into smaller parts and the risky parts can be developed earlier which helps in better risk management.

### Disadvantages
* Management is more complex.
* End of the project may not be known early.
* Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.
* Process is complex.
* Spiral may go on indefinitely.
* Large number of intermediate stages requires excessive documentation.
