The problem was that when you try to increase or decrease the font size, brackets doesn't let you if the new font size is more than the maxium font size (72px) or less than the minium font size (1px). Therefore, if the the font size in themes settings is 100px and you try to drecrease it pressing Ctrl+- nothing happens because the new font size will be 99px which is still more than 72px. 
Because I think it makes sense to be able to decrease the font size even though it is still more than the allowed I tried to solve the problem. So now if the font size is more than the maxium and you try to decrease it, it will decrese to the maxium font size, and if the font size is less than the minium and you increase it, it will increase to the minium font size.
I'm going to make a pull request now and wait for the update in the master repository.
