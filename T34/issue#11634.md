The issue, identified by the number #11634, which title is “too thick border on Windows 10”, is described as an aesthetic problem - a layout that doesn’t please the user. It only verifies itself on Windows, where the border lines of the display window are too thick.
</p>

## Requirements
The requirement is that the window’s border lines are thinner. 

## Source Code Files
The files that we had examined were the *.less* that took care of the layout and the .js files that took care of the panel:

* layout.less
* pane.js
* brackets.js
* panelManager.js

## Design of the Fix
<p align="justify">
In order to handle the <b>proposed</b> problem, we had to diminish the width/height of the border bars, while not ruining the appearance of the window’s content and the way it resizes.</p>

## Fix Source Code
The method to solve this was by hardcoding the desired values, instead of the defined variables they had.
